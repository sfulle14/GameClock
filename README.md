# Game Clock with Scoreboard

This is a game clock and scoreboard that was designed for wrestling with Tennessee High School rules as the design principals.  
It has button functionality for all scoring types and a simple game clock that can be increase or decreased as needed.  
Penalties, cautions, and stalling are all tracked in the program also to help make scoring easy.
